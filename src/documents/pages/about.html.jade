p I'm Paul Le Cam, a full-stack CoffeeScript developer from France.
p I enjoy creating great interfaces with current librairies such as Bootstrap, Require, Backbone and Handlebars, running with Node and some great modules such as Express.
p At the moment, I am focusing on user-perceived speed, trying to optimize client-side architecture around widgets and client-server communication and rendering, as you can see on my
