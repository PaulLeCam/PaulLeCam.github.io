<p>I can&#39;t remember when and where I read about the idea of Single-Page Applications for the first time, but I remember that I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>After all, it was about transfering as much logic as possible from the server to the client, so thinking much more about the user interactions than the constraints of server-side developments.</p>
<p>I started to create prototypes that were mainly running client-side, mostly using the server as a REST API with a MongoDB or Redis database behind. As I wrote in <a href="/posts/modular-design-and-librairies-abstraction/">part 1 of my client-side architecture series</a>, I used Aura at the time to create and manage widgets.</p>
<p>One thing that I really disliked using my applications, and I know it was a feeling I had as an <em>user</em> and not a developer, was that I always had to wait for the client code to load to actually being able to interact with the content. By that I mean that I had to wait until the client app loaded and sorted the items, before their corresponding views could be rendered and I could just <em>see</em> their content.</p>
<p>I felt very bad about it. Even though, as a developer, I could understand the whole process running in order to display the content I wanted, as an user I felt deeply frustrated seeing this loading animation, even for a few milliseconds.</p>
<p>As a developer, I could feel I was not doing something right. It took me some time until I realised that having created an &quot;app&quot;, I had forgotten about the Web.</p>
<p>The Web is the platform, and it&#39;s great. One of the great things about it are URIs. It allows us to <em>directly</em> access a specific content.</p>
<p>On my smartphone, when I click on links to newspapers articles that direct me to the correspondig page, and this page asks me to download their application, they are just doing it wrong. This is a terrible user experience, even more because I know that <em>I already should be</em> reading the content I wanted to read. The application would just get in the way, because I don&#39;t need it. The Web got it right the first time with the URI, I am on the page containing the content I wanted to read.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, without realizing it, it is somehow what I had created with my Single-Page Applications rendering content on the client. I had broken the promise that the URI would display the requested content. Instead, it was loading a client app and asking it to do the work. It is what this very simple, short-living loader was reprensenting: a broken promise that the content was accessible there.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I liked the ideas of Single-Page Applications, I liked to be thinking in terms of user interactions and events, but I did not want it to be more important than the content itself.</p>
<p>My idea was to be able to do both: being able to render content on the client or server, whatever is the most convenient or performant at the time. But because I was using Backbone for client-side developments, I also needed it on the server.</p>
<h2>Using Backbone on the server</h2>
<p>Backbone has no problem running &quot;as is&quot; with Node.</p>
<p>Problems come when you need to render views, because jQuery isn&#39;t there. Actually, the DOM isn&#39;t there, there&#39;s no DOM in Node.</p>
<p>Good thing is, there&#39;s a Node module for that! It&#39;s called <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a>, and it makes it <a href="https://github.com/PaulLeCam/node-slob/blob/master/src/jquery.coffee">very easy</a> to use jQuery thanks to it.</p>
<p>So it is pretty much what you need to use Backbone with Node, code made for the client just works with it.
I extended Backbone&#39;s classes according to my needs, most notably to be in sync with <a href="/posts/make-your-own-framework/">what I did client-side</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is probably in the way of rendering views, as I implemented in the <code>renderer()</code> method (that has <a href="https://github.com/PaulLeCam/slob-client/blob/master/src/ext/framework.coffee#L125">its equivalent client-side</a>), because instead of returning the view instance, it returns the full HTML element to be rendred:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="coffeescript">renderer: (html) -&gt;
  <span class="property">@$el</span>
    .attr(<span class="string">"data-view"</span>, <span class="property">@cid</span>)
    .html html
  template.renderSubViews <span class="property">@$el</span>
  <span class="property">@el</span>.outerHTML</code></pre>
<p>Note that my customization of Backbone server-side is really made to match what I did client-side, as presented in <a href="/posts/make-your-own-framework/">this article</a>.</p>
<h2>Loading modules with Node and Require</h2>
<p>The more I read about it, the more I discover ways of loading and packaging modules, both client-side and server-side.</p>
<p>npm is such a great tool I could not imagine not having it when I deal with Node. There is <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a> that seems to offer the same with client-side code, but I have never tried it.
With this project, I did not want to experiment new things, I only wanted to assemble things that I knew in a way I could easily use them, and my client-side code was using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> to define and load modules.</p>
<p>I ended-up having a simple boilerplate for shared code, that would work both with Node and RequireJS:</p>
<pre class="highlighted"><code class="coffeescript"><span class="function"><span class="title">run</span></span> = (mvc, exp) -&gt;

  exp <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">User</span> <span class="keyword">extends</span> <span class="title">mvc</span>.<span class="title">Model</span></span>

    store: <span class="keyword">new</span> mvc.Model.Store
    urlRoot: <span class="string">"/users"</span>
    idAttribute: <span class="string">"_id"</span>


<span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="keyword">typeof</span> exports <span class="keyword">is</span> <span class="string">"undefined"</span> <span class="comment"># Browser</span>
  define [<span class="string">"ext/framework"</span>], (framework) -&gt;
    run framework.mvc, (c) -&gt; c

<span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="comment"># Node</span>
  {framework} = require <span class="string">"slob"</span>
  run framework.mvc, (c) -&gt; module.exports = c</code></pre>
<p>I hope the code is pretty self-explanatory: the <code>run</code> function is what should work on both sides, and the last <code>exp</code> argument is where it should return the code to be exposed. The following code then loads and exposes the dependencies depending on the context, client or server.</p>
<h2>Connect middleware</h2>
<p>The purpose of this Node module was to offer a way to simply render on the server views that were originally meant to be created for the client.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, we need to have other Backbone components (models and collections) working as well, because views generally use them.</p>
<p>At this point, I figured that I only wanted to interact with these components in the server views, so all I needed was to load a Connect middleware exposing these functions, as presented <a href="https://github.com/PaulLeCam/node-slob/blob/master/src/middleware.coffee">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then from the views, it is very easy to load stuff by simply calling the helper: <code>view(&quot;userInfos&quot;, {model: model(&quot;user&quot;, user_data)})</code>, assuming <code>user_data</code> is the data sent to the view. The middleware would load, instanciate and render the corresponding content.</p>
